# Overview

The following select figures illustrate important differences between the NAPA model output and the NOAA OISST v2 product as well as AVISO+ SLA.

One may use the table of contents tab on the left side of this document to jump to a desired location.


# Distances

Firstly we look at the distance between the nearest OISST/AVISO pixel being compared to each NAPA pixel. Note that most pixels are within a few kms of one another, with the exception of several nearshore points that are not resolved in the model.

# Basic comparisons

The following subsection show the results of comparing basic summary statistics between the NAPA and OISST/AVISO data for each co-lacated pixel as seen in the distances section above.


## Summary stats

There are simply too many figures with too many panels to include here. It will rather be necessary to select key panels that illustrate specific patterns of interest or that are improtant for other reasons.
