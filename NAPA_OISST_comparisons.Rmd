The following select figures illustrate important differences between the NAPA model output and the NOAA OISST v2 product as well as AVISO+ SLA.

One may usethe table of contents tab on the left side of this document to jump to a desired location.


## Distances

Firstly we look at the distance between the nearest OISST/AVISO pixel being compared to each NAPA pixel. Note that most pixels are within a few kms of each other, with the exception of several nearshore points that are not included in the model.
